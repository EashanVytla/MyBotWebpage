											<h3>MyBot Workshop</h3>
											<h2>June 15-26, 2020</h2>
											<p>MyBot Cares hosted a 2-week summer camp teaching kids programming using the MyBot simulator. Despite the pandemic, I was able to utilize MyBot, IntelliJ, and Google Meet to create an effective virtual robotics learning experience. For many of our students, this was the first time that they were introduced to robotics. Through this camp, I was able to spark their interest in robotics and computer science, spreading STEM education throughout our community. The money raised from these camps went to purchasing headsets for Oyler School of Cincinnati to enhance the online and in-person learning experience for the students. I ended up raising $800 and purchased 65 headsets in total. The image above is the thank you note from the students at Oyler who were positively impacted by the headsets.</p>

											<h3>Quantum Leap x MyBot Workshop</h3>
											<h2>July 20-31, 2020</h2>
											<p>MyBot simulator and FIRST Tech Challenge Team 8719 Quantum Leap worked together to host both a basic programming camp and an advanced programming camp using MyBot simulator. Despite the pandemic, we were able to virtually spread robotics to kids around the nation at a low price of $50 for two weeks. The money that they raised went to support their team. The image above shows the curriculum of the basic programming camp. They also held an advanced programming camp just for FTC students with a slightly different curriculum that was geared toward success in the FTC field. The feature of having an FTC field in the app allowed students of this camp to replicate the FTC experience right from their computers.</p>

											<h3>Annual Thanksgiving Workshop</h3>
											<h2>Nov 23-37, 2020</h2>
											<p>MyBot simulator, FIRST Tech Challenge Team 8719 Quantum Leap and 18275 Subzero worked together to host one-week-long free workshop during thanksgiving break. This workshop ended up gaining over 50 students from around the world. In the camp, we taught rookie teams across the globe a little bit about FIRST Tech Challenge to kickstart them for the new challenge. We taught OpenCV detection, writing an OpMode, and writing an autonomous program. Thank you Subzero & Quantum Leap for helping organize such a great camp!</p>

											<h3>Annual Thanksgiving Workshop</h3>
											<h2>Nov 22-26, 2021</h2>
											<p>MyBot simulator, FIRST Tech Challenge Team 8719 Quantum Leap and 18275 Subzero partnered up once again to host one-week-long free workshop during thanksgiving break. This year, we reached over 70 students from around the world. It is by far the largest virtual workshop that we have ever hosted. In the camp, we taught rookie teams across the globe a little bit about FIRST Tech Challenge to kickstart them for the new challenge. We taught OpenCV detection, writing an OpMode, and writing an autonomous program. Once again, thank you Subzero & Quantum Leap for helping organize such a great camp!</p>

											<h3>OpenCV Workshop</h3>
											<h2>Nov 22-26, 2021</h2>
											<p>This year, MyBot cares wanted to introduce computer science to kids in a fun and engaging way: Computer Vision. I hosted a 5 day camp during Thanksgiving teaching 26 kids the basics of OpenCV. By the end of the camp, the kids were able to create a full classifier capable of counting the number of orange rings in a stack. It was a great experience teaching 6-9th graders such a powerful tool and inspiring them to continue their computer science and robotics endeavors!</p>
